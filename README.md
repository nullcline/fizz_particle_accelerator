[personal project] a "ball model" made for the 2022-2023 UBC e-week competition. the goal was to build something that can serve alcohol discretely, and is related to my engineering faculty (engineering physics)

There was no cad or schematic or anything for this, there was just a grand vision. i can't even find my firmware anymore. I built this in a week, partially drunk, the dean of engineering liked it and it won 2nd place. It used some submersible pumps driven with relays, controlled with an RP2040. the lights are WS2812b LEDs and are just programmed with an animation that makes the illusion of it moving really fast by changing more lights at once until it's basically just a strobe light.
